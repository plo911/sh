Reporting a Vulnerability	
I take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our project safe. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please disclose it responsibly by following these steps:

Report privately: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability. Instead, send a detailed report to [repi2.vik@gmail.com]. This allows the team or me to address the issue before it can be exploited.

Provide comprehensive information: Your report should include:

Version(s) affected: Specify the version(s) of the project where the vulnerability exists.

Detailed description: Clearly explain the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it. Include screenshots or code examples if applicable.

Impact: Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability.

Suggested solution (optional): If you have a suggestion for a fix, please include it.

Acceptance/Rejection: If the reported issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, I'll work to fix it promptly. I'll keep you informed of the status of the fix and release a security advisory once the fix is deployed. If the reported issue is not considered a vulnerability, I'll explain my reasoning.

Disclosure Coordination: We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until I have released a fix and published a security advisory. This allows me to ensure that all users are protected. I will work with you to coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.

I value your contribution to the security of my project and appreciate your responsible disclosure. Thank you for your help.
