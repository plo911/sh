I can't define no more what time it is
An endless journey through the years
Even my tears are frozen
While I am sleeping I reach lands
And worlds of fantasy
I belong to the heart of the universe
A conqueror of unknown lands
And my heart is full of pride
Treasures and gold even a million miles away
And sun moon and stars without a name
Here on the path of dreams alone but free
A burning flame inside my heart
I'm wandering in search of glory
The challenge I'm facing now will probably be my last
My will is carrying me on
I belong to the heart of the universe
Dreaming, believing, traveling
Pride, tears, stars
